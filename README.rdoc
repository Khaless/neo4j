= Neo4j.rb - Cluster Branch

Neo4j.rb is a graph database for JRuby.
 
It provides:
* Mapping of ruby objects to nodes in networks rather than in tables. 
* Storage of ruby object to a file system.
* Fast traversal of relationships between nodes in a huge node space.
* Transaction with rollbacks support. 
* Indexing and querying of ruby objects.
* Can be used instead of ActiveRecord in Ruby on Rails or Merb

It uses two powerful and mature java libraries:
* Neo4J (http://www.neo4j.org/) - for persistance and traversal of the graph
* Lucene (http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html) for quering and indexing.

=== Status
* There are over 200 RSpecs.
* Has been tested with a simple rails application, used Neo4j.rb instead of ActiveRecord
* Has been load tested (loaded 18000 nodes and done queries/travesal in several threads.)
* Has not been used in production yet (as far as I know).

== Installation

To install it:

   gem install neo4j

To install from the latest source:
  git clone git://github.com/andreasronge/neo4j.git
  cd neo4j
  rake gem:install

JRuby version 1.1.4 does not work with Neo4j.rb because of a JRuby bug.
This bug is fixed in JRuby 1.1.5. 

== Ten Minute Tutorial

=== Creating a model

  require "rubygems"
  require "neo4j"

  class Person
    include Neo4j::NodeMixin

    # define Neo4j properties
    property :name, :salary.

    # define an one way relationship to any other Person node
    has_n(:friends).to(Person)

    # adds a lucene index on the following properties
    index :name, :salary
    index 'friends.age' # index each friend age as well
  end

The example above specifies how to map a Neo node to a ruby Person instance.
Neo properties and relationships are declared using the 'property' and 'has_n'/'has_one' NodeMixin class method.
In the example above a lucene index will be updated when the name or salary property changes. 
The salary of all friends are also indexed which means we can query for people who has friends with a certain salary.

=== Creating a node

Creating a Person node instance

  person = Person.new

=== Setting properties

Setting a property:

  person.name = 'kalle'
  person.salary  = 10000

If a transaction is not specified then the operation will automatically be wrapped in
a transaction.  Neo4j does handle primitive properties of type like String, Fixnum, Float.

=== Queries

There are different ways to write queries.
Using a hash:
  Person.find (:name => 'kalle', :age => 20..30)  # find people with name kalle and age between 20 and 30

or using the lucene query language:
  
  Person.find("name:kalle AND salary:[10000 TO 30000]")

The Lucene query language supports wildcard, grouping, boolean, fuzzy queries, etc...
For more information see: http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/queryparsersyntax.html

=== Sorting, example

  Person.find(:name => 'kalle').sort_by(:salary)
  Person.find(:name => 'kalle').sort_by(Desc[:salary], Asc[:country])
  Person.find(:name => 'kalle').sort_by(Desc[:salary, :country])

=== Search Results

The query is not performed until the search result is requested.
Example of using the search result.

  res = Person.find(:name => 'kalle')
  res.size  # => 10
  res.each {|x| puts x.name}
  res[0].name = 'sune'

=== Relationships

Adding a relationship between two nodes:

  person2 = Person.new
  person.friends << person2

Traversing relationships

  person.friends.each {|n| ... }

Traversing using a filter

  person.friends{ salary == 10000 }.each {|n| ...}

Deleting a relationship

  person.relations[person2].delete

Deleting a node (and all its relationships)

  person.delete

=== Example on Relationships

A more complecated example that shows how to navigate from incomming and
outgoing relationships.

      class Role
        include Neo4j::RelationMixin
        property :name
      end

      class Actor
        include Neo4j::NodeMixin
        has_n(:acted_in).to(Movie).relation(Role)
      end
      
      class Movie
        include Neo4j::NodeMixin
        property :title
        property :year

        # defines a method for traversing incoming acted_in relationships from Actor
        has_n(:actors).from(Actor, :acted_in)
      end


Notice that relationships also can have properties.
Creating a new Customer Order relationship can be done like this

      keanu_reeves = Actor.new
      matrix       = Movie.new
      keanu_reeves.acted_in << matrix

or you can also specify this relationship on the incoming node

      keanu_reeves = Actor.new
      matrix       = Movie.new
      matrix.actors << keanu_reeves

Example of accessing the Role between an Actor and a Movie

      keanu_reeves = Actor.new
      matrix       = Movie.new
      role = keanu_reeves.acted_in.new(matrix)
      role.name = 'neo'

or
      keanu_reeves = Actor.new
      matrix       = Movie.new
      keanu_reeves.acted_in << matrix
      keanu_reeves.acted_in
      keanu_reeves.relations.outgoing(:acted_in)[matrix].name = 'neo'

More information about neo4j can be found after the Lucene section below.

== The Lucene Module

You can use this module without using the Neo4j module. 

Example of how to write a document and find it:
(a document is like a record or row in a relation database).
  
    require 'lucene'

    include Lucene

    # the var/myindex parameter is either a path where to store the index or
    # just a key if index is kept in memory (see below)
    index = Index.new('var/myindex')  

    # add one document (a document is like a record or row in a relation database)
    index << {:id=>'1', :name=>'foo'}

    # write to the index file
    index.commit

    # find a document with name foo
    # hits is a ruby Enumeration of documents
    hits = index.find{name == 'foo'}

    # show the id of the first document (document 0) found
    # (the document contains all stored fields - see below)
    hits[0][:id]   # => '1'    

Notice that you have to call the commit method in order to update the index on the disk/RAM.
By performing several update and delete operations before a commit will be much
faster then performing commit after each operation. 

=== Keep indexing on disk

By default Neo4j::Lucene keeps indexes in memory. That means that when the application restarts
the index will be gone and you have to reindex everything again.

To keep indexes in memory:

   Lucene::Config[:store_on_file] = true
   Lucene::Config[:storage_path] => '/home/neo/lucene-db'

When creating a new index the location of the index will be the Lucene::Config[:storage_path] + index path
Example:

   Lucene::Config[:store_on_file] = true
   Lucene::Config[:storage_path] => '/home/neo/lucene-db'
   index = Index.new('/foo/lucene')

The example above will store the index at /home/neo/lucene-db/foo/lucene

=== Indexing several values with the same key

Let say a person can have several phone numbers. How do we index that ?

  index << {:id=>'1', :name=>'adam', :phone => ['987-654', '1234-5678']}
  

=== Id field

All Documents must have one id field. If one is not specified it is :id of type String.
A different id can be specified using the field_infos id_field property on the index:

  index = Index.new('some/path/to/the/index')
  index.field_infos.id_field = :my_id

To change the type of the my_id from String to a different type see below.

=== Conversion of types

Lucene.rb can handle type conversion for you. (The java lucene library stores all
the fields as Strings)
For example if you want the id field to be a fixnum

    require 'lucene'
    include Lucene

    index = Index.new('var/myindex')  # store the index at dir: var/myindex
    index.field_infos[:id][:type] = Fixnum    

    index << {:id=>1, :name=>'foo'} # notice 1 is not a string now

    index.commit

    # find that document, hits is a ruby Enumeration of documents
    hits = index.find(:name => 'foo') 

    # show the id of the first document (document 0) found
    # (the document contains all stored fields - see below)
    doc[0][:id]   # => 1     

If the field_info type parameter is not set then it has a default value of String.

=== Storage of fields

By default only the id field will be stored.
That means that in the example above the :name field will not be included in the document.

Example
    doc = index.find('name' => 'foo') 
    doc[:id]   # => 1     
    doc[:name] # => nil

Use the field info :store=true if you want a field to be stored in the index
(otherwise it will only be searchable).

Example

    require 'lucene'
    include Lucene

    index = Index.new('var/myindex')  # store the index at dir: var/myindex
    index.field_infos[:id][:type] = Fixnum    
    index.field_infos[:name][:store] = true # store this field

    index << {:id=>1, :name=>'foo'} # notice 1 is not a string now

    index.commit

    # find that document, hits is a ruby Enumeration of documents
    hits = index.find('name' => 'foo') 

    # let say hits only contains one document so we can use doc[0] for that one
    # that document contains all stored fields (see below)
    doc[0][:id]   # => 1     
    doc[0][:name] # => 'foo'

=== Setting field infos

As shown above you can set field infos like this

  index.field_infos[:id][:type] = Fixnum    

Or you can set several properties like this:

  index.field_infos[:id] = {:type => Fixnum, :store => true}    


=== Simple Queries

Lucene.rb support search in several fields:
Example

    # finds all document having both name 'foo' and age 42
    hits = index.find('name' => 'foo', :age=>42)  

Range queries

    # finds all document having both name 'foo' and age between 3 and 30
    hits = index.find('name' => 'foo', :age=>3..30)  

=== Lucene Queries

If the query is string then the string is a lucene query.

  hits = index.find('name:foo')

For more information see:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/queryparsersyntax.html

=== Advanced Queries (DSL)

The queries above can also be written in a lucene.rb DSL:

    hits = index.find { (name == 'andreas') & (foo == 'bar')}

Expression with OR (|) is supported, example

   # find all documents with name 'andreas' or age between 30 and 40
    hits = index.find { (name == 'andreas') | (age == 30..40)}

=== Sorting

Sorting is specified by the 'sort_by' parameter
Example

  hits = index.find(:name => 'foo', :sort_by=>:category)

To sort by several fields:

  hits = index.find(:name => 'foo', :sort_by=>[:category, :country])

Example sort order

  hits = index.find(:name => 'foo', :sort_by=>[Desc[:category, :country], Asc[:city]])

=== Thread-safety

The Lucene::Index is thread safe.
It guarantees that an index is not updated from two thread at the same time.


=== Lucene Transactions

Use the Lucene::Transaction in order to do atomic commits.
By using a transaction you do not need to call the Index.commit method.

Example:

    Transaction.run do |t|
      index = Index.new('var/index/foo')        
      index << { id=>42, :name=>'andreas'}
      t.failure  # rollback
    end  
    
    result = index.find('name' => 'andreas')
    result.size.should == 0

You can find which documents are uncommited by using the uncommited index property.

Example

      index = Index.new('var/index/foo')        
      index.uncommited #=> [document1, document2] 

Notice that even if it looks like a new Index instance object was created the index.uncommited
may return an not empty array. This is because Index.new is a singleton - a new instance object is not created.

== The Neo4j Module

=== Start and Stop of the Neo Database

By default lucene indexes are kept in memory.
Keeping index in memory will increase the performance of lucene operations (such as updating the index).

Example to configure Lucene to store indexes on disk instead

   Lucene::Config[:store_on_file] = true
   Lucene::Config[:storage_path] => '/home/neo/lucene-db'

Before using Neo4j the location where the database is stored on disk must be configured:

   Neo4j::Config[:storage_path] = '/home/neo/neodb'

To stop the neo database - you do not need to do this since it will be done automatically when the virtual machine exits.

   Neo4j.stop


=== Neo4j::NodeMixin

Neo4j::NodeMixin is a mixin that lets instances to be stored as a node in the neo node space on disk.
A node can have properties and relationships to other nodes.

Example of how declare a class that has this behaviour:

  class MyNode 
     include Neo4j::NodeMixin
  end

=== Index in Memory instead of disk

If index is stored in memory then one needs to reindex all nodes when the application starts up again.

   MyNode.update_index # will traverse all MyNode instances and (re)create the lucene index in memory.


=== Create a Node

If a block is provided then the creation of the instance will be performed in an
transaction, see below for more information on transactions.

  node = MyNode.new { }

=== Delete a Node

The Neo4j::NodeMixin mixin defines a delete method that will delete the node and all its relationships.

Example:

  node = MyNode.new
  node.delete

The node in the example above will be removed from the neo database on the filesystem and the lucene index

=== Node Properties

In order to use properties they have to be declared first

  class MyNode
     include Neo4j::NodeMixin
     property :foo, :bar
  end

These properties (foo and bar) will be stored in the Neo database.
You can set those properties:

  # create a node with two properties in one transaction
  node = MyNode.new { |n|
     n.foo = 123  
     n.bar = 3.14
  }
 
  # access those properties
  puts node.foo
  

You can also set a property like this:

    f = SomeNode.new
    f.foo = 123

Neo4j.rb supports properties to by of type String, Fixnum, Float and true/false

=== Property Types and Marshalling

If you want to set a property of a different type then String, Fixnum, Float or true/false
you have to specify its type.

Example, to set a property to any type

  class MyNode
    include Neo4j::NodeMixin
    property :foo, :type => Object
  end


  node = MyNode.new
  node.foo = [1,"3", 3.14]

  Neo4j.load(node.neo_node_id).foo.class # => Array


=== Property of type Date and DateTime

Example of using Date queries:

  class MyNode
    include Neo4j::NodeMixin
    property :since, :type => Date
    index :since, :type => Date
  end

  node.since = Date.new 2008,05,06
  MyNode.find("born:[20080427 TO 20100203]")[0].since # => Date 2008,05,06

Example of using DateTime queries:

  class MyNode
    include Neo4j::NodeMixin
    property :since, :type => DateTime
    index :since, :type => DateTime
  end

  node.since = DateTime.civil 2008,04,27,15,25,59
  MyNode.find("since:[200804271504 TO 201002031534]")[0].since # => DateTime ...

Only UTC timezone is allowed.

=== Finding all nodes

To find all nodes of a specific type use the all method.
Example

  class Car
    include Neo4j::Node
    property :wheels
  end

  class Volvo < Car
  end

  v = Volvo.new
  c = Car.new

  Car.all   # will return all relationships from the reference node to car obejcts
  Volvo.all # will return the same as Car.all

To return nodes (just like the relations method)

  Car.all.nodes    # => [c,v]
  Volvo.all.nodes  # => [c,v]


=== Relationship has_n

Neo relationships are none symmetrical. That means that if A has a relation to B
then it may not be true that B has a relation to A.

Relationships has to be declared by using the 'relations' class method.
For example, let say that Person can have a relationship to other nodes with the type 'friends':

  class Person 
     include Neo::Node
     has_n :knows  # will generate a knows method for outgoing relationships
     has_n(:known_by).from(:knows)  #  will generate a known_by method for incomming knows relationship
  end

Example how to add a relation to another node:

  me = Person.new 
  neo = Person.new
  me.knows << neo # me knows neo but neo does not know me

Notice that you can also add relationship on the incoming relationship
The following example is the same as the example above:

  me = Person.new 
  neo = Person.new
  neo.known_by << me # neo is known by me, that means that I know neo but neo does have to know me
  
=== Relationship has_one

Example of has_one: A person can have at most one Address

      class Person
        include Neo4j::NodeMixin
        has_one(:address).to(Address)
      end

      class Address
        include Neo4j::NodeMixin
        property :city, :road
        has_n(:people).from(Person, :address)
      end

In the example above we have Neo4j.rb will generate the following methods
 * in Person, the method ''address='' and ''address''
 * in Address, the traversal method ''people'' for  traversing incomming relationships from the Person node.

Example of usage

      p = Person.new
      p.address = Address.new
      p.address.city = 'malmoe'


Or from the incoming ''address'' relationship

      a = Address.new {|n| n.city = 'malmoe'}
      a.people << Person.new


=== Properties on a relationship

A relationship can have properties just like a node. 

Example:

  p1 = Person.new
  p2 = Person.new

  relation = p1.friends.new(p2)

  # set a property 'since' on this relationship bewteen p1 and p2
  relation.since = 1992

If a Relationship class has not been specified for a relationship then any properties
can be set on the relationship. It has a default relationship class: Neo4j::DynamicRelation

=== Traversing relationships:

Each type of relationship has a method that returns an Enumerable object that enables you
to traverse that type of relationship. 

For example the Person example above declares one relationship of type friends.
You can traverse all Person's friend by doing:

  f.friends.each { |n| puts n }

=== Filtering nodes in a relationship

If you want to find one node in a relationship you can use a filter.
Example, let say we want to find a friend with name 'andreas'

  n1 = Person.new
  n2 = Person.new {|n| n.name = 'andreas'}
  n3 = Person.new
  n1.friends << n2 << n3
  n1.friends{ name == 'andreas' }.to_a # => [n2]

The block { name == 'andreas' } will be evaluated on each node in the relationship.
If the evaluation returns true the node will be included in the filter search result.

=== Finding Relationships

Given we have the two nodes with a relationship between them:

  n1 = Person.new
  n2 = Person.new
  
  n1.friends << n2

Then we can find all incoming and outgoing relationships like this:

  n1.relations.to_a # => [#<Neo4j::RelationMixin:0x134ae32]

A Neo4j::RelationMixin object represents a relationship between two nodes.

  n1.relations[0].start_node # => n1
  n1.relations[0].end_node # => n2

Relationships can also have properties just like a node.

=== Finding outgoing and incoming relationships

If we are only interested in all incoming nodes, we can do 

  n2.relations.incoming # => [#<Neo4j::RelationMixin:0x134ae32]

Or outgoing:

  n1.relations.outgoing # => [#<Neo4j::RelationMixin:0x134aea2]

To find a specific relationship use the [] operator:

  n1.relations.outgoing[n2] = #<Neo4j::RelationMixin:0x134aea2

Or which is better performance wise (since only friends relationships are being traversed):

  n1.relations.outgoing(:friends)[n2] = #<Neo4j::RelationMixin:0x134aea2

=== Deleting a relationship

Use the Neo4j::RelationMixin#delete method.
For example, to delete the relationship between n1 and n2 from the example above:

    n1.relations.outgoing(:friends)[n2].delete

=== Finding nodes in a relationship

If you do not want those relationship object but instead want the nodes you can use the 'nodes' method
in the Neo4j::RelationMixin object.

For example:

  n2.relations.incoming.nodes # => [n1]

=== Finding outgoing/incoming nodes of a specific relationship type

Let say we want to find who has my phone number and who consider me as a friend

  # who has my phone numbers
  me.relations.incoming(:phone_numbers).nodes # => people with my phone numbers

  # who consider me as a friend
  me.relations.incoming(:friend).nodes # => people with a friend relationship to me

Remember that relationships are not symmetrical.

=== Transactions

All operations that work with the node space (even read operations) must be wrapped in a transaction.
Luckly neo4j.rb will automatically create a transaction for those operation that needs it if one is not already provided.

For example all get, set and find operations will start a new transaction if none is already not runnig (for that thread).

If you want to perform a set of operation in a single transaction, use the Neo4j::Transaction.run method:

Example

  Neo4j::Transaction.run {
    node1.foo = "value"
    node2.bar = "hi"
  }

There is also a TransactionalMixin that lets you declare which method should be wrapped inside a transaction.
Example:

  class Person
    include Neo4j::NodeMixin
    extend Neo4j::TransactionalMixin

    property :name, :age

    def do_stuff
      # ... no transaction stuff needed to be written here.
    end

    transactional :do_stuff
  end

==== Rollback

Neo4j support rollbacks on transaction. Example:
Example:

  include 'neo4j'

  node = MyNode.new

  Neo4j::Transaction.run { |t|
     node.foo = "hej"
     # something failed so we signal for a failure 
     t.failure # will cause a rollback, node.foo will not be updated
  }


You can also run it without a block, like this:

   transaction = Neo4j::Transaction.new
   transaction.start
   # do something
   transaction.finish

=== Indexing

Properties and relationships which should be indexed by lucene can be specified by the index class method.
For example to index the proeprties foo and bar

  class SomeNode
     include Neo4j::NodeMixin
     property :foo, :bar
     index :foo, :bar
  end

Everytime a node of type SomeNode (or a subclass) is create, deleted or updated the lucene index of will be updated.

=== Deleting or Reindex

Sometimes it's neccessarly to change the index of a class after alot of node instances already have been created.
To delete an index use the class method 'remove_index'
To update an index use the class method 'update_index' which will update all already created nodes in the neo database.

Example

  class Person
    include Neo4j
    property :name, :age, :phone
    index :name, :age
  end

  p1 = Person.new {|n| n.name = 'andreas'; n.phone = 123}
  Person.find (:name => 'andreas') # => [p1]
  Person.find (:phone => 123) # => []

  # change index and reindex all person nodes already created in the neo database.
  Person.remove_index :name
  Person.index :phone  # add an index on phone
  Person.update_index

  Person.find (:name => 'andreas') # => []
  Person.find (:phone => 123) # => [p1]


=== Quering (using lucene)

You can declare properties to be indexed by lucene by the index method:

Example

      class Person 
        include Neo4j::NodeMixin
        property :name, :age
        index :name, :age
      end
    
      node = Person.new
      node.name = 'foo'
      node.age  = 42


      Person.find(:name => 'foo', :age => 42) # => [node]

The query parameter (like property on a Neo4j::NodeMixin) can be of type String, Fixnum, Float, boolean or Range.
The query above can also be written in a lucene query DSL:

      Person.find{(name =='foo') & (age => 42)} # => [node]

Or lucene query language:
       
     Person.find("name:foo AND age:42")

For more information see: http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/queryparsersyntax.html or the lucene module above.


=== Indexing and Property Types

In order to use range querie on numbers the property types must be converted.
This is done by using the :type optional parameter:

  class Person
    include Neo4j::NodeMixin
    property :name, :age
    index :age, :type => Fixnum
  end

By using :type => Fixnum the age will be padded with '0's (lucene only support string comparsion).

Example, if the :type => Fixnum was not specified then

  p = Person.new {|n| n.age = 100 }
  Person.find(:age => 0..8) # => [p]

=== Indexing and Quering Relationships

The Neo4j::NodeMixin#index method can be used to index relationships to other classes.

Example, let say we have to classes, Customer and Orders:
  
  class Customer
    include Neo4j::NodeMixin

    property :name

    # specifies outgoing relationships to Order
    has_n(:orders).to(Order)

    # create an index on customer-->order#total_cost
    index "orders.total_cost"
  end


  class Order
    include Neo4j::NodeMixin

    property :total_cost

    # specifies one incoming relationship from Customer
    has_one(:customer).from(Customer, :orders)

    # create an index on the order<--customer#name relationship
    index "customer.name"
  end

Notice that we can index both incoming and outgoing relationships.

Let's create a customer and one order for that customer

    Neo4j::Transaction.run do
      cust = Customer.new
      order = Order.new
      cust.name = "kalle"
      order.total_cost = "1000"

      cust.orders << order 
    end

Now we can find both Orders with a total cost between 500 and 2000 and Customers with name 'kalle' using lucene

Example:

   customers = Customer.find('orders.total_cost' => 500..2000, 'name' => 'kalle')

Or also possible from the other way:

   orders = Order.find('total_cost' => 500..2000, 'customer.name' => 'kalle')

=== Full text search

Neo4j supports full text search by setting the tokenized property to true on an index.
(see JavaDoc for org.apache.lucene.document.Field.Index.ANALYZED).

  class Comment
    include Neo4j::NodeMixin

    property :comment
    index comment, :tokenized => true
  end


=== Unmarshalling

The neo module will automatically unmarshalling nodes to the correct ruby class.
It does this by reading the classname property and loading that ruby class with that node.

  class Person 
    include Neo::Node

    def hello
    end
  end

  f1 = Person.new {}
  
  # load the class again
  f2 = Neo4j.load(foo.neo_node_id)
  
  # f2 will now be new instance of Person, but will be == f1
  f1 == f2 # => true

=== Reference node

There is one node that can always be find - the reference node, Neo4j::ReferenceNode.
Example:

    Neo4j.ref_node

This node has a relationship to all created nodes.
It is used internally to recreate an index or finding all nodes of a specific type.

== Ruby on Rails with Neo4j.rb

Neo4j.rb does work nicely with R&R.

It has been verified on rail 2.2.2, JRuby 1.1.6 RC1, Glassfish 0.9.1.

=== Configuration

==== Install Neo4j.rb
  gem install neo4j

==== Install rails
  gem install rails

==== Create a rails project, movies
  rails movies

==== Config rails
Config rails to use Neo4j.rb instead of ActiveRecord, edit movies/config/environment.rb
environment.rb:
  config.frameworks -= [ :active_record ] #, :active_resource, :action_mailer ]
  config.gem "neo4j", :version => "0.0.7"

==== Create Models
Create model in movies/app/models
actor.rb:

  class Role
    include Neo4j::RelationMixin
    property :title, :character
  end

  class Actor
    include Neo4j::NodeMixin
    property :name, :phone, :salary
    has_n(:acted_in).to(Movie).relation(Role)
    index :name
  end

movie.rb:
  class Movie
    include Neo4j::NodeMixin
    property :title
    property :year

    # defines a method for traversing incoming acted_in relationships from Actor
    has_n(:actors).from(Actor, :acted_in)
  end

==== Create RESTful routes
Edit the config/routes.rb file

  ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
     map.resources :actors do |actor|
      actor.resources :acted_in
      actor.resource :movies, :controller => 'acted_in'
     end

==== Create Controllers

Add the following controllers in app/controllers

actors_controller.rb:

    class ActorsController < ApplicationController
      before_filter :find_actor, :only => [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]

      def index
        @actors = Actor.all.nodes
      end

      def create
        @actor = Actor.new
        @actor.update(params[:actor])
        flash[:notice] = 'Actor was successfully created.'
        redirect_to(@actor)
      end

      def update
        @actor.update(params[:actor])
        flash[:notice] = 'Actor was successfully updated.'
        redirect_to(@actor)
      end

      def destroy
        @actor.delete
        redirect_to(actors_url)
      end


      def edit
      end

      def show
      end

      def new
        @actor = Actor.value_object.new
      end

      private
      def find_actor
        @actor = Neo4j.load(params[:id])
      end
    end


acted_in_controller.rb:

    class ActedInController < ApplicationController
      def index
        @actor = Neo4j.load(params[:actor_id])
        @movies = @actor.acted_in.nodes
      end

      def create
        @actor = Neo4j.load(params[:actor_id])
        @movie = Movie.new
        @movie.update(params[:movie])
        @actor.acted_in << @movie
        flash[:notice] = 'Movie was successfully created.'
        redirect_to(@actor)
      end

      def update
        @actor = Neo4j.load(params[:actor_id])
        @movie = Movie.new
        @movie.update(params[:movie])
        @actor.acted_in.new @movie
        @movie.update(params[:movie])
        flash[:notice] = 'Movie was successfully updated.'
        redirect_to(@movie)
      end

      def show
        @movie = Neo4j.load(params[:id])
      end

      def new
        @actor = Neo4j.load(params[:actor_id])
        @movie = Movie.value_object.new
      end

      def edit
        @movie = Neo4j.load(params[:id])
      end
    end

==== Add views

Add the following views in app/views/actors
index.html.erb:

    <h1>Listing actors</h1>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
      </tr>

      <% for actor in @actors %>
        <tr>
          <td><%=h actor.name %></td>
          <td><%= link_to 'Edit', edit_actor_path(actor) %></td>
          <td><%= link_to 'Show', actor %></td>
          <td><%= link_to 'Destroy', actor, :confirm => 'Are you sure?', :method => :delete %></td>
        </tr>
      <% end %>
    </table>

    <br />

    <%= link_to 'New actor', new_actor_path %>

new.html.erb:

    <h1>New Actor</h1>

    <% form_for(@actor) do |f| %>
      <p>
        <%= f.label :name %><br />
        <%= f.text_field :name %>
      </p>
      <p>
        <%= f.label :phone %><br />
        <%= f.text_field :phone %>
      </p>
      <p>
        <%= f.label :salary%><br />
        <%= f.text_field :salary %>
      </p>
      <p>
        <%= f.submit "Update" %>
      </p>

    <% end %>



    <%= link_to 'Back', actors_path %>
